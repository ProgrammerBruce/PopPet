PopPet Arduino Code
===================

This is Arduino Code for my PopPet app. 
(You can find the app on Google Play here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cevinius.PopPet)

PopPet is a robot kit developed by Jaidyn Edwards. (You can find out more about PopPet 
here: http://www.poppettherobot.com/)

In collaboration with Jaidyn, I made an app for PopPet. In order to use the app, you need to load
the Arduino code in this repository onto PopPet.

The Arduino code enables PopPet to respond to various commands received via the Serial Port. (There 
are more details in the code comments.)

You can adapt this Arduino code to work with other differential drive robots! As long as the code understands the
command set that I've implemented, you should be able to use the app with other differential drive robots.

Also, if you ask me questions there, I'll try to help.
